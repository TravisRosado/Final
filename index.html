    <h1>The Legendary Blade!</h1>
    <h2>By [Travis Rosado]</h2>
    <p>The story begins with a short tale of a legendary blade the lies in the woods.
      Its been said, that during the day the blade will shine as bright as star. However,
      in the night, the blade will show its dark power. When making this short animation
      I wanted to do something that was fantasy like. So I decided that I wanted to make a animation about a blade that lies in a certain location, aka the woods, that has unique
      properties.</p>
